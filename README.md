# PASSWORD-MANAGER

- This is a password manager app written in python using tkinter GUI library
  
- Responsible for generating unhackable password for a user and store them for that user
  
- The user first create an account , then after the his account has been created locally , the password entered will be used to encrypts his/her password which will be generated & encrypted and then store on a txt file locally.
  
- The user can retrieve the decrypted passwords by providing the correct password for his account , then enter an account name in order for the system to retrieve the encrypted stored password to decrypt it and display it

- This system is a bit safe because the password of the user is not stored locally

- Now I am currently working in using AES salt to encrypt the users passwords && login pin because it is stored locally

- This project have helped me also in learning on how to develop object orientated GUI classes in python
